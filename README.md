Hi, I'm Raphael Odinamkpa and when I wrote this tool (2022) I was 20 years old. I took part of the code from books/blog and I riadapted it especially for this tool. You have certainly noticed that it has 9 manner: port scanning, sniffing, DDos attacks, ARP poisoning, bruteforce, trojan creation, chat room ssh, site mapper and username finder. Obviously everything is open source and you can modify the code based on your needs, I tryed to make it the more complete I could hope you'll like it and it will be useful.
To start it you have to type the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/Dionsyius/https---github.com-Dionsyius-Open-Source.git
```
```
cd main
```
```
cd bash_file
```
```
chmod +x install.sh
```
```
./install.sh
```
```
cd ../code
```
```
sudo python3 main.py
```

OBVIOUSLY EVERYTHING IS WRITTEN FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE, THE USER KNOW WHAT HE IS DOING AND THE AUTHOR IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY ILLEGAL USE OF THIS TOOL
